### CPP Programing Course's Note 
*<div align="right">-24.11.12 by LenFu</div>*

#### 0. The Rule of Five
1. Destructor: Used to release all resources acquired by an object during its lifetime.
2. Copy Constructor: Used to create a new object as a copy of another object of the same class.
3. Copy Assignment Operator: Used to assign the contents of one object to another object of the same class.
4. Move Constructor: Used to create a new object that takes ownership of the resources of another object, without copying them.
5. Move Assignment Operator: Used to transfer the ownership of resources from one object to another.

#### 1. Manage C++ Header Files
```
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H
......(content)
#endif //MYHEADER_H
```

#### 2. Set Function into Struct
Define function in the struct:

    #include<iostream>
    struct Mystruct {
        int value;
        void display() const {
            std::cout << value << std::endl // The Content of the Function.
        }
    };
    int main(){
        Mystruct test;

        test.value = 1;

        test.display()
    return 0;
    }
Define Function outside the Class:


    struct MyStruct {
        int value;

        void display() const;
    };

    void Mystruct::display() const {
        std::cout << value << std::endl;
    }


#### 3. Class's Definition
Sorted by Access Level:
- Private: It's only accessed by other members of the same class and not visible to any code outside of the class.
- Public: It can be accessed from any code that has access to the object, including classes and functions.
- Protected: Members marked as protected are not accessible from outside the class but can be accessed by classes that inherit from it.
#### 4. Object's Definition
An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on a class and contains real values in its attributes. An object is created from a class and has the class's attributes and methods.
```
#include <iostream>

// Define a class named 'Car'
class Car {
public:
    // Attribute (data member)
    std::string brand;

    // Constructor to initialize the object
    Car(std::string b) : brand(b) {}

    // Method (member function)
    void display() {
        std::cout << "The car brand is: " << brand << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an object of 'Car'
    Car myCar("Toyota");

    // Call the method of the object
    myCar.display();

    return 0;
}
```
#### 5. Struct and Class
- struct: The default access level for members in a struct is public
- class: The default access level for members in a class is private.
##### 1. Constructor and Destructor
###### Characteristics of Constructors:
- Initialization: Constructors are used to initialize the object's attributes with specific values.
- Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is created. This happens when declare an object of a class.
- Name: The constructor has the same name as the class.
- Parameters: Constructors can have parameters, allowing you to pass values to initialize the object.
- **Overloading**: You can have multiple constructors with different parameters to handle different initialization scenarios.
- No Return Type: Constructors do not specify a return type, not even void.
- Object Creation: Constructors are an essentia part of the object creation process. They ensure that an object is in a valid state before it is used.
- Default Constructor: If a class does not explicitly define a constrector, the compiler automatically generates a default constructor, which initializes member variables to their default values.
- **Copy Constructor**: A copy constructor is a special constructor that creates an object by copying the values of another object of the same class.
- Destuctor Pairing: It's a good practice to pair constructors with destructors to manage resources properly, especially when dealing with dynamic memory, file handles, or other resources that need to be released.

###### 2. Characteristics of Destructors:
- Name Matching: A destructor must have the same name as the class but is preceded by a tilde (~).
- No Return Type: Destructors do not specify a return type.
- Automatic Invocation: Destructors are automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
- Resource Cleanup: They are typically used to release resources, such as memory, file handles, or network connections, that the object may have acquired.
- Virtual Destructors:  If a class is intended to be a base class for other classes, its destructor should be declared as virtual. This enseures that the correct destructor is called when an object is deleted through a base class pointer.
- Single Destructor per Class: A class can have only one destructor.
- **No Throwing Exceptions**: Destructors cannot throw exceptions. If a destructor throws an exception, the program may terminate abruptly, causing data corruption or resource leaks.
- Order of Destruction:
    - Objects with member objects or base classes: Destructors are called in the reverse order of their construction.
    - Member objects: Destructors of member objects are called before the destructor of the containing class.
    - Inheritance: Destructors of base classes are called after the destructor of the derived class.
- ***If there exists pointers, then you must use Destructor.***
For example:
```
class MyClass {
    private:
        int num,val;
        int *storage;

        // Constructor
        MyClass() {
            storage = new int[10]; // Allocate memory
        }

        // Destructor
        ~MyClass() {
            delete[] storage; // Release memory
            std::cout << "Object destroyed and memory released" << std::endl;
        }
};
```
###### 3. Initialzation List

```
MyClass::MyClass(int x,int y):num(x),val(y){
    storage = new int[2];
}
```
###### 4. Delegating Constructors
They are a feature that allows one constructor to call another constructor in the same class to reuse its initialization code. This can be particularly useful for reducing code duplication and improving readability, especially in classes with multiple constructors that perform similar initialization tasks.
For example:
```
class MyClass {
private:
    int num;
    std::string name;

public:
    // Primary constructor
    MyClass(int num, std::string name) : num(num), name(std::move(name)) {
        // Initialization code specific to this constructor
    }

    // Delegating constructor
    MyClass(int num) : MyClass(num, "") { // Delegates to the primary constructor
        // Additional initialization specific to this constructor
    }
};
```
###### 5.Copy Constructor
The copy constructor should be marked as const because it does not modify the object it is called on, and it should take a constant reference to the class type as its parameter to avoid unnecessary copies.
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
private:
    std::string name;
    int value;

public:
    // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass(std::string n, int v) : name(n), value(v) {}

    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : name(other.name), value(other.value) {
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Other member functions...
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1("Kimi", 42);
    MyClass obj2 = obj1; // Copy constructor is called here

    return 0;
}
```
###### 6. The liftime of the Object
for example:
```
class MyClass{}
MyClass gObj;
int main{
    MyClass lObj1;
    static MyClass sObj;
    MyClass lObj2;
}
```
Construction Order:
1. gObj
2. lObj1
3. sObj
4. lObj2
Destruction Order:
1. lObj2
2. lObj1
3. **sObj**
4. gObj

##### 2. "this" pointer
**Purpose**
- Identifying the Object: The this pointer allows member functions to access the object on which they are called. It provides a way for the function to refer to the object itself.
- Accessing Private Members: It enables member functions to access private members of the class.
- Returning a Reference to the Object:Functions can return a reference to *this, allowing the function to return the object itself.
**Usage**
- Implicit Use: In most cases, this is used implicitly. When you call a member function, the compiler passes the this pointer as an argument to the function.
- Explicit Use: 
    - Distinguishing Between Parameters and Members: When a parameter name is the same as a member variable, this can be used to distinguish between them.
    - Returning a Reference to *this: In member functions that return a reference to the object itself, this is used to return the current object.
For example:
```
class Person{
    private:
        int id;
        int age;
    public:
        Person(int id,int age):id(id), age(age){
            storage = new char[30];
        }

        Person(int id,int age):{
            this.id = id;
            this.age = age;
        }
        // Actually the upper one is better than the lower one for the compiler.
}
```

#### 6. Specific Members
##### 1.Const Member
###### 1. Const Member Function
****
- 
```
class MyClass {
private:
    int value;

public:
    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {}

    // Const member function
    int getValue() const {
        return value;
    }

    // Non-const member function
    void setValue(int val) {
        value = val;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj(10);
    int val = obj.getValue(); // OK: getValue is a const member function
    // obj.setValue(20); // Error: main function is considered const, so non-const member functions cannot be called
    return 0;
}
```
###### 2. Const Member Data
- Initialization: const member data must be initialized in the member initializer list of every constructor in the class. They cannot be assigned a value in the constructor body or after the object has been constructed.
- Immutable State: Declaring a member variable as const makes that part of the object's state immutable, which can be useful **for ensuring thread safety and for creating classes that are immutable**.
- Access: const member data can be accessed by both const and non-const member functions.
- Override: If a const member data is overridden in a derived class, the overriding member must also be const.
- Read-Only Access: Outside of the class, a const member data can only be accessed through a const reference or pointer to the class.
##### 2. Static Member
**It is the properties of the class rather than the object.**
###### 1. Static Member Data
A static member is a member that belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific object of the class. It is shared among all objects of the class.
For example:
```
class Bank{
    private:
        static int val;
    public:
        static int rate;
}
```
But there are many disadvantages:
- Shared State: Since static data members are shared across all instances of a class, changes made to the static member by one object can affect all other objects. This shared state can lead to unintended side effects and make the program's behavior harder to predict and debug.
- Concurrency Issues: In multithreaded applications, static data members can lead to race conditions if multiple threads attempt to modify the same static member simultaneously. Synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure thread safety.
- Lifetime: Static members have static storage duration, which means they are initialized before main() starts and destroyed after main() ends. This can lead to issues if the static member depends on certain initialization order or if it needs to be cleaned up before the program terminates.
- Hidden Dependencies: The use of static data members can create hidden dependencies within a program. Functions or methods that rely on static data members may not be easily testable or reusable because their behavior can be influenced by the state of the static member, which is not always clear from the function's signature.
- Namespace Pollution: Static members that are declared public and accessible globally can lead to namespace pollution, making it harder to manage and avoid naming conflicts, especially in large programs with many classes.
- Singleton-Like Behavior: Overreliance on static members can lead to a design that mimics the singleton pattern, which can have its own set of problems, such as global state management and difficulty in testing.
- Initialization Order Fiasco: In more complex programs with multiple translation units, static and global variables from different translation units are initialized in an unspecified order, which can lead to the initialization order fiasco, where one static variable may be initialized before another, causing undefined behavior if they depend on each other.

- Limited Encapsulation: Static data members are not encapsulated within individual objects. This means that the principles of object-oriented design, such as encapsulation and information hiding, are not fully adhered to with static members.

- Inheritance Issues: Static data members do not participate in inheritance, which can be a limitation if you are trying to extend the behavior of a base class.

- Memory Management: Since static members are allocated at the class level, they consume memory for the duration of the program, which can be a concern in memory-constrained environments.

###### 2. Static Member Function
**Characteristics**:
- Class-Scope Function: Static member functions are defined at the class scope and can be called without creating an instance of the class. They are invoked using the class name and the scope resolution operator (::).

- **Access to Static Data Members**: Static member functions can access other static members of the class but cannot access non-static members, as there is no instance of the class to provide the context for non-static members.

- **Const-Correctness**: Static member functions can be marked as const, meaning they promise not to modify any static or non-static members of the class.

- **No this Pointer**: Since static member functions do not operate on a specific object, they do not have access to the this pointer.

- Declaration and Definition: Static member functions are declared inside the class and defined outside the class, just like static data members.

- Inheritance: Static member functions do not override or hide non-static member functions in base classes. They are not part of the polymorphism mechanism and cannot be virtual.

- Utility Functions: Static member functions are often used for utility or helper functions that perform operations related to the class but do not require an instance of the class to be meaningful.

- Singleton Access: Static member functions can be used to access static data members that act as a singleton, providing a global point of access to a single value or object.

- Friend Functions: Static member functions can be friends of other classes, allowing them to access private and protected members of the friend class.

```
class UtilityClass {
public:
    static int staticData;  // Static data member

    static void staticFunction(data) {
        staticData = data;
    };  // Static member function
};
```

##### 3. Friend
**Properties**
- Access Rights: Friends have the same access rights to the class's private and protected members as the class itself. They can read and modify these members without any restrictions.

- Declaration: Friends are declared inside the class definition using the friend keyword. They are not members of the class, so they do not appear in the class's member list.

- **Non-Members**: Friends can be functions or classes that are not members of the class. They can be defined anywhere in the program, but they must be declared as friends within the class.

- Function Friends: When a function is declared as a friend, it can access the private and protected members of the class directly.

- **Class Friends**: When a class is declared as a friend, all its member functions (including non-static members) can access the private and protected members of the class.

- Mutual Friendship: If class A is a friend of class B, and class B is a friend of class A, they can access each other's private and protected members.

- Inheritance: Friend functions do not inherit their friendship status to derived classes. Each class must declare its own friends.

- Template Friends: In template classes, friends must be declared within the template definition and cannot be declared outside it.

- Limited Encapsulation: While friends can break encapsulation, they should be used judiciously to maintain the integrity of the class design.

#### 7. Operator Overloading
##### 1. Overloading of +-*/ 
It enables you to use standard operators like +, -, *, /, and others with your own classes, making the code more intuitive and similar to how operators are used with built-in types.

- Syntax: Operator overloading is done by defining a non-static member function for the operator you want to overload. The operator is specified using a special syntax, such as operator+() for the addition operator.

- Limitations: Some operators cannot be overloaded, including . (member access), .* (pointer to member), :: (scope resolution), and a few others.

- Overloading for Different Types: You can overload operators for different types of operands. For example, you can overload the + operator to work with two operands of the same class, or one operand of the class and another of a different type.

- Free Functions for Binary Operators: Binary operators can also be overloaded as free (non-member) functions if they are declared as friends of the class. This is useful when you want the left operand to be of a different type.

- Unary Operators: Unary operators like !, & (address-of), * (dereference), ++, and -- can be overloaded as member functions.

- Assignment Operators: The assignment operator = and compound assignment operators like +=, -=, etc., can be overloaded to define custom assignment behavior.

- Subscript Operator: The subscript operator [] can be overloaded to define custom behavior for array-like access.

- Function Call Operator: The function call operator () can be overloaded to allow objects of a class to be called like functions.

- Comparison Operators: Operators like <, >, ==, <=, >=, and != can be overloaded to define custom comparison logic.

- Implicit Conversions: Some operators, like type casting operators, can be used to define implicit conversions to other types.
```
class Complex {
public:
    double real, imag;

    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload the + operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }

    // Overload the << operator to print Complex objects
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Complex& c) {
        os << "(" << c.real << ", " << c.imag << ")";
        return os;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(1.0, 2.0), c2(3.0, 4.0);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2; // Uses the overloaded + operator
    std::cout << c3 << std::endl; // Uses the overloaded << operator
    return 0;
}
```
##### 2. Opeartor overloading for assignment
This is particularly important when your class manages resources such as dynamic memory, file handles, or any other kind of resource that requires special handling to avoid resource leaks or other issues.
- Custom Behavior: You can define what happens when one object is assigned to another, which is not limited to just copying data.

- Self-Assignment: Always check for self-assignment, where an object is assigned to itself. This is done by checking if the source and destination objects are the same using this != &other.

- Resource Management: Handle the release of resources in the current object and the acquisition of resources from the source object.

- Copy-and-Swap Idiom: A common and safe way to implement the assignment operator is by using the copy-and-swap idiom, which involves copying the source object and then swapping the resources with the source object.

- Return Value: The assignment operator should return a reference to *this to allow for chained assignments.

- Const Correctness: The assignment operator should be marked as const if it does not modify the observable state of the object being assigned to.
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int* ptr;

    MyClass(int value) : ptr(new int(value)) {}

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete ptr;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : ptr(new int(*other.ptr)) {}

    // Copy assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) { // Check for self-assignment
            delete ptr; // Release existing resource
            ptr = new int(*other.ptr); // Copy resource from other
        }
        return *this; // Return a reference to *this
    }

    // Move constructor
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : ptr(other.ptr) {
        other.ptr = nullptr;
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) { // Check for self-assignment
            delete ptr; // Release existing resource
            ptr = other.ptr; // Take ownership of other's resource
            other.ptr = nullptr; // Leave other in a valid state
        }
        return *this; // Return a reference to *this
    }
};
```
