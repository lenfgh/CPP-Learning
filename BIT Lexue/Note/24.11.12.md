###### 1. Manage C++ Header Files
```
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H
......(content)
#endif //MYHEADER_H
```

###### 2. Set Function into Struct
Define function in the struct:

    #include<iostream>
    struct Mystruct {
        int value;
        void display() const {
            std::cout << value << std::endl // The Content of the Function.
        }
    };
    int main(){
        Mystruct test;

        test.value = 1;

        test.display()
    return 0;
    }
Define Function outside the Class:


    struct MyStruct {
        int value;

        void display() const;
    };

    void Mystruct::display() const {
        std::cout << value << std::endl;
    }


###### 3. Class's Definition
Sorted by Access Level:
- Private: It's only accessed by other members of the same class and not visible to any code outside of the class.
- Public: It can be accessed from any code that has access to the object, including classes and functions.
- Protected: Members marked as protected are not accessible from outside the class but can be accessed by classes that inherit from it.
```

```

###### 4. Object's Definition
An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on a class and contains real values in its attributes. An object is created from a class and has the class's attributes and methods.
```
#include <iostream>

// Define a class named 'Car'
class Car {
public:
    // Attribute (data member)
    std::string brand;

    // Constructor to initialize the object
    Car(std::string b) : brand(b) {}

    // Method (member function)
    void display() {
        std::cout << "The car brand is: " << brand << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an object of 'Car'
    Car myCar("Toyota");

    // Call the method of the object
    myCar.display();

    return 0;
}
```
###### 5. Struct and Class
- struct: The default access level for members in a struct is public
- class: The default access level for members in a class is private.
###### 6. Constructor and Destructor

Characteristics of Destructors:
- Name Matching: A destructor must have the same name as the class but is preceded by a tilde (~).
- No Return Type: Destructors do not specify a return type.
- Automatic Invocation: Destructors are automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
- Resource Cleanup: They are typically used to release resources, such as memory, file handles, or network connections, that the object may have acquired.
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int *data;

    // Constructor
    MyClass() {
        data = new int[10]; // Allocate memory
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete[] data; // Release memory
        std::cout << "Object destroyed and memory released" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

###### 7. Define Copy Function

```
struct Point {
    private:
        int x,y;
    
    public:
        Point(int a, int b):x(a),y(b){};
        Point(const Point &p){
            this->x = p.x;
            this->y = p.y; 
        }

}

Point p1=Point(10,20);
Point p2=p1;
```

###### 8. Const Member Function

```
class MyClass {
private:
    int value;

public:
    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {}

    // Non-const member function
    void setValue(int val) {
        value = val;
    }

    // Const member function
    int getValue() const {
        return value;
    }
};
```
