### 1. Pointer
#### 1. Reinterpret cast
```
int x,*p=&x;
float *fp = reinterpret_cast<float*>(p);
//float *fp = reinterpret_cast<float*>&x;
```
#### 2. Const and Pointer
- **const int *p**;
     - This declares a pointer p that points to a constant of type int.
    - The value that p points to cannot be modified, but p itself can point to different constant integers.
- **int const *p = &x**;
    - This is equivalent to the first snippet. It declares a pointer p that points to a constant of type int.
    - The initialization p = &x assigns the address of the variable x to p, making p point to x.
    - Since p points to a constant, the value of x cannot be modified through p, but p can point to other constant integers.
- **const in *const p = &x**;
    - This declares a constant pointer p that points to a constant of type int.
    - The value that p points to cannot be modified, and p itself cannot point to different constant integers.
    - The initialization p = &x assigns the address of the variable x to p, making p point to x.
    - Since p is a constant pointer, it cannot be changed to point to another variable, and the value of x cannot be modified through p.

#### 3. Multi-level pointer
- Declaration: A double pointer in C++ is declared by using two asterisks **. For example, int** pptr is a pointer to a pointer to an int.

- Memory Allocation: Multi-level pointers are often used when you need to allocate memory dynamically for an array of pointers or when you need to modify the address that a pointer holds.

- Indirection: Accessing the value through a multi-level pointer requires multiple levels of dereferencing.

- Use Cases: They are used in scenarios such as creating a dynamic array of strings, managing a matrix, or implementing data structures like linked lists or trees.

Example (Double Pointer to Modify a Value):
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value; // ptr is a pointer to an int
    int** pptr = &ptr; // pptr is a pointer to a pointer to an int

    // Dereferencing to access the original value
    std::cout << "Original value: " << **pptr << std::endl;

    // Modify the value through the double pointer
    **pptr = 20;

    std::cout << "Value after modification: " << value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Example(Double Pointer with Dynamic Memory Allocation):
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int** pptr = new int*[10]; // Allocate memory for an array of 10 pointers

    // Allocate memory for 10 integers and assign them to the array of pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        pptr[i] = new int(i);
    }

    // Access and print the values
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Value at pptr[" << i << "]: " << *pptr[i] << std::endl;
    }

    // Deallocate memory
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        delete pptr[i];
    }
    delete[] pptr;

    return 0;
}
```
Example(Triple Pointer):
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 100;
    int* ptr = &value;
    int** pptr = &ptr;
    int*** ppptr = &pptr;

    // Dereference all the way to the original value
    std::cout << "Original value: " << ***ppptr << std::endl;

    // Modify the value through the triple pointer
    ****ppptr = 200;

    std::cout << "Value after modification: " << value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### 4.Function Pointers
- Declaration of Function Pointers
    **Syntax: returnType (*functionName)(arg_type1,arg_type2,...);**
- Example(Different Return Types and Arguments)

    ```
    #include <iostream>

    int add(int, int);
    int (*ptr_to_add)(int, int) = add;

        int main() {
            std::cout << "Result: " << ptr_to_add(5, 3) << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }

    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    ```
- Example(Function Pointers and Arrays)
    ```
    #include <iostream>

    void foo() { std::cout << "foo" << std::endl; }
    void bar() { std::cout << "bar" << std::endl; }

    int main() {
        void (*functions[])() = {foo, bar};
        int n = sizeof(functions) / sizeof(functions[0]);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            (*functions[i])(); // Call the function pointed to by functions[i]
        }

        return 0;
    }


#### 5. Pointers to struct

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        int age;
    };

    int main() {
        Person person = {"Kimi", 30}; // Initializing a struct variable
        Person* ptr = &person;       // Taking the address of the struct variable

        // Accessing struct members via pointer
        ptr->name = "Moonshot";
        ptr->age = 25;
    //  (*ptr).name = "Moonshot";
    //  (*ptr).age = 25;



        std::cout << "Name: " << ptr->name << ", Age: " << ptr->age << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation
#### 1. new Operator
**Syntax: pointer = new type;**

    int *p = new int;


#### 2. delete Operator

**Syntax: delete pointer;**

    delete p;

#### 3. new[] Operator
**Syntax: pointerArray = new type[size];**

    int *p = new int[10];

#### 4. delete[] Operator
**Syntax: delete[] pointerArray;**

    delete[] p;


### 3. Assert

    #include<cassert>

- Usage: assert is used to catch programming errors, such as invalid assumptions or unexpected states, that should not occur during normal execution.

- Condition: The assert macro takes a condition as its argument. If the condition evaluates to false, the program will terminate.

- Disabled in Release Builds: By default, assert is enabled in debug builds but disabled in release builds to avoid the performance overhead of checking conditions at runtime.

- Custom Message: Some implementations of assert allow you to provide a custom message that will be printed when the assertion fails.

- No Return Value: Since assert can potentially terminate the program, it does not return a value.

- Standard Library Support: In C++, assert is defined in the <cassert> header file, and in C, it is defined in assert.h. It is part of the Standard Library's support for debugging.

- Alternatives: In production code, you might use exceptions or error handling mechanisms instead of assert, as they allow the program to recover from errors.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <cassert>

    int main() {
        int x = 10;
        // This assertion will pass silently because the condition is true.
        assert(x == 10);

        // This assertion will trigger and terminate the program because the condition is false.
        assert(x != 10);

        return 0;
    }


### 4. Memory Distribution
#### 1. Heap
- The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- It is not as quickly accessed as the stack because memory is allocated and deallocated explicitly by the programmer using operators like new and delete in C++.
- The heap is managed by the program and the runtime system, and it can grow and shrink as needed.
- Memory management on the heap is more complex and requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks and other issues like fragmentation.
- Example: Dynamically allocating an array of objects using new would allocate memory on the heap.

#### 2. Stack
- The stack is a region of memory that is used for **storing local variables, function parameters, and return addresses**.
- It operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) basis, meaning the most recently added item is the first one to be removed.
- Memory allocation and deallocation are automatic and fast, as the stack has a **fixed size** and uses **a contiguous block of memory.**
- Variables allocated on the stack are usually **deallocated when the function or block in which they are defined returns**.
- Example: When a function is called, space for its local variables is allocated on the stack.
#### 3. Global and Static Storage
- This region holds global variables and static variables, which have a lifetime that extends for the duration of the program.
- Global variables are those declared outside of any function or class, while static variables are those declared within a function or class with the static keyword.
- These variables are initialized only once when the program starts and are not destroyed until the program terminates.
- The initialization order of global and static variables can be a complex issue, especially in large programs with multiple translation units.
- Example: A variable declared as int globalVar; would be stored in the global/static storage area.

### 5. Reference
- Constant Reference:A reference can be declared as const to prevent the referenced variable from being modified through the reference, like const int& cref.
- Passing by Reference: References are often used as function parameters to avoid copying large objects and to allow the function to modify the original object.
- Reference to Function:  A reference can also refer to a function, allowing for more concise syntax when passing functions as arguments to other functions.
- Initialization: A reference must be initialized when it is declared because it does not have an independent existence. It must be bound to an existing variable.
- Declaration: A reference is declared using an ampersand & after the type name but before the variable name, like int& refName;.

Example(Const Reference):

    #include <iostream>

    void printValue(const int& val) {
        std::cout << "Value: " << val << std::endl;
    }

    int main() {
        int number = 5;
        printValue(number); // Pass by const reference to avoid copying

        // The following line would cause an error because val is const.
        // val = 10;

        return 0;
    }

Example(Reference to Pointer):

    #include <iostream>

    void increment(int*& ptr) {
        (*ptr)++; // Dereference ptr to increment the value
    }

    int main() {
        int value = 7;
        increment(&value); // Pass address of value

        std::cout << "Value after increment: " << value << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }


Example(Passing by Reference to Modify Original): 

    #include <iostream>

    void doubleValue(int& num) {
        num *= 2;
    }

    int main() {
        int x = 3;
        doubleValue(x);
        std::cout << "x after doubleValue: " << x << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

Example(Returning Reference)

    #include <iostream>

    int& getReferenceToMax(int& a, int& b) {
        return (a > b) ? a : b;
    }

    int main() {
        int num1 = 40;
        int num2 = 50;
        int& maxRef = getReferenceToMax(num1, num2);
        std::cout << "Max value: " << maxRef << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }


Example(Reference to Function):

    #include <iostream>

    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    }

    void sayGoodbye() {
        std::cout << "Goodbye, World!" << std::endl;
    }

    void callFunction(void (&func)()) {
        func();
    }

    int main() {
        callFunction(greet); // Pass greet function by reference
        callFunction(sayGoodbye); // Pass sayGoodbye function by reference

        return 0;
    }

#### 2. Reference of right 
##### 1. Right Value
- Temporary Objects: R-values often come from temporary objects that are created during an expression, such as the result of a function call or an arithmetic operation.

- Move Semantics: C++11 introduced move semantics, which allows for efficient transfer of resources from an r-value to an l-value (a named object with identity), preventing unnecessary copies.

- R-value References: C++11 introduced r-value references, which are references to r-values. They are declared with two ampersands &&, like int&& ref = someExpression;.

- std::move: The std::move function is used to cast an l-value to an r-value reference, which is necessary to trigger move semantics.

- Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO): Some compilers optimize away the temporary object and directly return the object from a function, which can be thought of as a form of r-value.

- Lifetime: R-values have a very short lifetime; they are typically destroyed at the end of the full expression in which they are created.

##### 2. R-value Reference
- Declaration: R-value references are declared using Type&&, where Type is the data type of the r-value.

- Binding: R-value references can only be bound to r-values, not l-values. This means they can only refer to temporary objects or objects that are about to be destroyed.

- Move Semantics: R-value references are used to implement move semantics, which allows resources to be transferred from an r-value to an l-value efficiently.

- std::move: The std::move function is used to cast an l-value to an r-value reference, which is necessary to trigger move semantics.

- Perfect Forwarding: R-value references, along with template aliases (using typename or using), are used to implement perfect forwarding in template functions.

### 6.There is no dynamic two-dimensional array in C++

#### 1. One-dimensional array Method

    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        int rows = 5;
        int cols = 4;
        int totalSize = rows * cols; // Total number of elements

        // Create a single pointer to the entire array
        int* arr = new int[totalSize];

        // Initialize the array
        for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; ++i) {
            arr[i] = i; // Some initialization logic
        }

        // Access and print the array
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                std::cout << arr[i * cols + j] << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }

        // Deallocate memory
        delete[] arr;

        return 0;
    }


### 7. Lambda Expression
**Syntax**

    [capture] (parameters) -> return_type { body }

- [capture]: This part is used to capture variables from the surrounding scope. It can be empty, capture by value (x or &x), capture by reference (x&), or a mix of both.
- (parameters): This is the parameter list of the lambda function, similar to a regular function.
- -> return_type: This is the return type of the lambda function. If the return type can be deduced, this part can be omitted.
- { body }: This is the body of the lambda function, where the function's logic is defined.
Example(Basis Lambda Expression)


    #include <iostream>
    #include <algorithm>
    #include <vector>

    int main() {
        std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        // Lambda to double each element
        auto doubler = [](int x) {
            return 2 * x;
        };

        // Using the lambda to transform the vector
        std::transform(nums.begin(), nums.end(), nums.begin(), doubler);

        // Print the transformed vector
        for (int num : nums) {
            std::cout << num << " ";
        }

        return 0;
    }


**Lambda and std::function**
Lambda expressions can be converted to std::function objects, which are function wrappers that can store, copy, and call any callable target.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <functional>

    int main() {
        auto square = [](int x) { return x * x; };
        std::function<int(int)> func = square;

        std::cout << "Square of 5: " << func(5) << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }


### 8. Head file
#### 1.#ifndef...#endif

    // my_class.h
    #ifndef MY_CLASS_H
    #define MY_CLASS_H

    class MyClass {
    public:
        void display() const;
    };

    #endif // MY_CLASS_H


### 9. Objected-Oriented Programming
#### 1. Classes and Objects
- Class: A class in C++ is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.
- Object: An object is an instance of a class. Each object can have its own unique data.
#### 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also helps in hiding the internal state of the object from the outside world, which is known as data hiding.
#### 3. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) takes on the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (base class or parent class). It supports the concept of code reusability.
#### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super-type. It enables a single interface for different underlying forms (data types).
#### 5. Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It involves simplifying complex structures so that the user can interact with them without needing to understand the underlying complexity.
#### 6. Association
Association is a type of relationship between two classes where one class is associated with another. This is often used to model real-world relationships.
#### 7. Aggregation
Aggregation is a part-whole relationship where a class is composed of other classes, but the parts can exist independently of the whole.
#### 8. Composition
Composition is a more intimate part-whole relationship than aggregation, where the parts cannot exist independently of the whole.`
